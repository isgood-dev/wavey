## About
Wavey is a music player that lets you play music (or any audio) onto your device. It has many features to make your experience better!

## Install
This section is being worked on to make sure that wavey is as easy to install as possible. That said, the only way to install it currently is to build it from source.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have `Rust` installed (and `git` if you choose to `git clone` the repository).

### Download source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/isgood-dev/wavey & cd wavey
```

### Build and run:
```
cargo run --release
```
Don't forget the `--release`! This tells the compiler to optimize the build and massively improves performance.
